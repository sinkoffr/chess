# README

This started as a group project as part of the firehose project curriculum on 
this repository: https://github.com/the-initiators/the-initiators-chess repository.

When the group project ended multiple team members expressed interest in working
alone to complete the app so I started a new repository with the work we had 
completed as a team so I could continue working on this project without confusion 
from other team members work.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
